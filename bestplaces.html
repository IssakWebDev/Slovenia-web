           living there. It lays by the river Drava in the embrace of the green forests of Pohorje and picturesque wine-growing hills.
           Maribor is known for it's eye catching Old Vine which is the oldest vine in the world, in fact it has 450 year old guinness world 
           record. The city is the informal capital of Slovenska Å tajerska and is considered the economic, financial, administrative, educational,
            cultural, health, trade and tourist center of the entire northeastern Slovenia In 2000, Maribor was Alpine City of the Year, in 2012 
            European Capital of Culture and European Rafting City, and in 2013 European Youth Capita.

                After the attack on Yugoslavia on 6th of April 1941 german army already occupied Maribor on 8th of April.
                Like most of northern Slovenia, it belonged to the German occupation zone. On April 26, 1941, Maribor was visited by Adolf Hitler,
                the leader of the German Reich. In Maribor Castle, he met with the Maribor Nazi leadership, and then he saw the destroyed Old Bridge.
                Apart from Paris, Maribor was the only city outside the borders of the German Reich that Hitler personally visited after the occupation. 
                April 28, 1941. The occupation repression was particularly severe in Maribor. The German authorities introduced a strong denationalization 
                policy: they abolished Slovenian education, banned the public use of Slovenian and Germanized personal names and street names.
                More than 5,000 residents of Maribor were quickly deported to Serbia, Croatia and Germany. Since 1942, Slovene worship was also prohibited.

                at the junction of Gorenjska, Notranjska and Dolenjska.Throughout history, Ljubljana has been influenced by several cultures, as it was at 
                the crossroads of Germanic, Romanic and Slavic peoples, their languages, traditions and customs.
                Throughout history, Ljubljana has been influenced by several cultures, as it was at the crossroads of Germanic, Romanic and Slavic peoples, their languages, traditions and customs.
                Ljubljana is a city that will surprise you and exceed your expectations. It is unique - small in area, but big in hospitality and quality of life. Her name, if we consider one of 
                the etymological interpretations, means "beloved", and therefore it is not surprising that she is loved by the townspeople and visitors. For that to be the case, a lot of changes had to happen. 
                And these many changes in a very short time are also one of the reasons why Ljubljana became the Green Capital of Europe 2016. It became the first and only green oasis in the 
                central and south-eastern part of Europe.</p>

                    With the expansion of Julius Caesar's empire comes the establishment of the Roman town Emona on the left bank of the Ljubljanica, 
                    of which some remains can still be found in today's Ljubljana. Thriving for a relatively short period of time, Emona is abandoned some 
                    time during the 6th century AD, and the region is invaded several times by the Huns and other early Germanic tribes.

                    Ljubljana is first mentioned in writing in 1144. The now primarily Slavic city is invaded by the Habsburgs, who control the city and Slovenia 
                    almost uninterrupted up until WWI. The city expands during the first 
                    few hundred years of this period and the basic shape of the Old Town as it is today is laid out.

                    As one of the oldest coastal towns in Slovenia, and a major port, Koper is an integral part of the country's infrastructure. This is yet another coastal spot that was once part of the Venetian Empire, 
                    and it formally went by the name Caprea. Later, it became part of Yugoslavia. Today, Koper is a lesser-known destination that

                    Koper's narrow streets and old houses still reflect the Venetian influence. 
                    On Titov Trg, the main square, stand the Cathedral of the Assumption (Stolnica Marijinega) and several Venetian palaces, 
                    including the Praetorian Palace, which dates from the mid-15th century. In 1991, when Slovenia gained independence, the port of 
                    Koper was the scene of the departure of the Yugoslav army, which is commemorated by a monument. In 1957 work on new port facilities 
                    on the eastern side of Koper began, in 1967 a railway link with the hinterland was completed, and today Koper is a major port for the 
                    landlocked countries of central Europe (e.g., Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia). 
                    It is the site of a regional museum. Koper has multiple beaches to swim and enjoy the landscape on.</p>
