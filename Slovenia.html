       <h2 class="old-flute">A 60,000-YEAR-OLD <span class="flute-section">FLUTE</span></h2>

       <p class="flute-info">
        The area of Slovenia has been settled since Prehistory, which is evidenced by incredible findings found in today's Divje Babe Archaeological 
        Park. There is a cave in the steep hillside of Å ebrelje Plateau, which is considered to be one of the most important sites with Stone Age 
        findings in the world. In it, the bones of more than 60 different animal species, most significantly those of a cave bear, tools made of 
        stone and bone, and remains of fire pits used by Ice Age people were found. During excavation, archaeologists were surprised by a bone that 
        proved to be a musical instrument made from the left thigh-bone of a young cave bear. It was made 60,000 years ago by a Neanderthal who used 
        tools made of stone and bone to carve four holes and a mouthpiece into the bone. Contrary to theories that were held to be true for a 
        long time, the flute, which can be seen at the National Museum in Ljubljana, proves that Neanderthals were a developed spiritual creature, 
        capable of refined artistic creation. The Neanderthal flute, which is considered to be the oldest musical instrument in the world, can also 
        produce 
        complex music.

        <p class="needle-info">
            At an elevation 1700 metres, on Mt OlÅ¡eva, from where there is an incredible view of the Kamnik and Savinja Alps and the Logar Valley, you can
            find a cave called PotoÄka Zijalka. In addition to the remains of a cave bear, a wolverine, and other animals, archaeologists also excavated 
            the remains of fire pits, various stone artefacts, and bone tips. From among all of the findings that can now be seen at the Celje Regional 
            Museum,a 30,000-year-old bone needle stands out. This artefact is decorated with a variety of circles and curves, which shows that Ice Age 
            people had some artistic tendencies. The PotoÄka Zijalka Cave is incredibly important for understanding the course of the WÃ¼rm Glaciation in 
            the Alps and for the exploration of the flora and fauna of the time, 
            as well as the life of Ice Age people.

        <h2 class="independence-yugo">S<span class="love-section">LOVE</span>NIAN INPENDENCE FROM <span class="yugoslavia-section">YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
        <p class="war-independence">
            The independent state of the Republic of Slovenia was created on 25 June 1991 out of the federal republic of Slovenia, which was previously a part of the Socialist 
            Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
        </p>

        <p class="yugoslavia-dash">
            The country of Slovenia emerged in the first half of the 19th century as a term to denote the territory in the southern area of the
             Austrian dominions inhabited by a Slovene-speaking population. Up until 1918 under the Austrians no political territory with such a 
             name had been formed, but the concept of Slovenia had nevertheless acquired a socially tangible and potentially even political dimension. 
             After the First World War the majority of Slovenia's territory came under the Yugoslav state, in which the Slovene people lived their own 
             autonomous cultural life. After the Second World War the communist federal Yugoslav state gained further slices of Slovene ethnic territory 
             from Italy, and the Slovene republic thereby incorporated a 
            greater part of the actual Slovene ethnic lands, complete with an opening to the Adriatic Sea at Koper.
        </p>

        <p class="yugo-dash">
            Within federal Yugoslavia, the Slovene nation made good progress both economically and culturally, and consolidated its national existence 
            despite the communist regime 
            which ruled Yugoslavia after the Second World War.
        </p>

        <p class="yugo-dash2">
            In the acute crisis facing the Yugoslav communist system from the middle of the 1980's, a crisis that was also manifested in interethnic 
            relations, it became clear that the Yugoslav communists, including those of Slovenia, were not able to offer any new paths for the 
            continued development of the multi-ethnic Yugoslav state community. It became clear that the social, economic, cultural and political 
            structure of the Slovene nation was not 
            compatible with the structures of the other Yugoslav nations.
        </p>

        <p class="yugo-dash3">
            It was thus that in the spring of 1987 a group of intellectuals with anti-communist leanings appeared, 
            centring themselves around the Nova revija magazine and contributing to it articles for a new Slovene national programme. 
            In these articles they called for an abandoning of the communist system and the introduction of a politically pluralist, 
            democratic system, a free market economy with public welfare and an independent Slovene state. This was over two and a 
            half years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, and 
            Yugoslavia was still governed by a communist system that rejected these demands.
        </p>

        <p class="yugo-dash4">
            Among the Slovenes, however, these demands quickly won the sympathies of the broad mass of people, including many Slovene communists. 
            In the spring of 1989 Slovenia's communist leadership recognised this new trend in the mood of the people, and began siding with it, 
            particularly during the heightened inter-ethnic tensions in Kosovo. In May 1989 the leadership permitted a large popular gathering in 
            Ljubljana in support of the demands from the Nova revija circle for an independent Slovene state. Up until spring 1990 the communists 
            attempted to resolve the Slovene national question in the form of an asymmetric Yugoslav federation, but in September 1989 they 
            nevertheless supported the amendments to Slovenia's constitution involving the sovereignty of the Slovene nation to dispose of its GDP and to 
            command the armed forces in the territory of the Slovene republic
        </p>

        <p class="yugo-dash5">
            The Yugoslav government did not agree with the declaration of an independent Slovenia, and attempted to block it through action by the Yugoslav army (YNA).
            On the very night of Slovenia's declaration of independence the YNA started to occupy the republic's border crossings, with the aim of 
            cutting Slovenia off from the outside world and keeping it in the Yugoslav structure. There were also secret plans to replace the regime in 
            Slovenia. The Slovene leadership responded to the YNA acts by mobilising the local territorial defence force and the police, who started 
            blocking and attacking the YNA units. The resistance to the YNA, which the Slovene leadership had declared to be an enemy force, was taken up 
            spontaneously and in large numbers by ordinary Slovenes. The ten-day war for Slovenia's independence had started. After two days the Slovene 
            resistance was already showing results. The YNA threatened Slovenia with retaliatory measures using all-out force. Public opinion in Europe 
            started leaning in Slovenia's favour. In order to prevent any exacerbation or extension of the war, the "troika" from the European Community, 
            Jaques Poos, Hans van den Broek and Gianni de Michelis, arrived in Zagreb on 29 June 1991 and attempted to broker a ceasefire. 
            But the military operations continued unabated up until 2 July. On that day a Slovene delegation arranged with the European troika in 
            Zagreb a ceasefire on the basis of a prior agreement on 1 July in Ljubljana between the Slovene leadership and a delegation of the 
            Yugoslav government headed by its prime minister Ante Markovic. At that moment the YNA had already been defeated in Slovenia. 
            On 7 July the mediation of European diplomats at a meeting of Yugoslav and Slovene delegations produced an agreement. 
            The Republic of Slovenia retained control over its territory, including its external borders, while the Slovene forces released their 
            blockade of YNA units, which had to return to barracks, all prisoners of war were released and for three months Slovenia had to refrain 
            from any further independence measures.
